Strunk and White:  A style guide
================================

Stunk and White is a grassroots attempt to codify the conventions used by UT Libraries Digital Initiatives to write and
maintain code.  By documenting and adopting shared practices, it is easier to perform code review and approval and merge
pull requests.  It also helps keep our revision history clean and helps onboard new people easy.

Since we've been writing code for years and it'd be expensive to retroactively require all of our repositories to adhere
to the conventions below, we instead encourage you to consider the following:

1. When starting a new repo, create a CONTRIBUTING file in your repository.  In the file, point at this guide.
2. Are you working on something with others in the department?  Is there a guide for the language you are using? If so,
   adhere to the guide and create a CONTRIBUTING file accordingly.  If not, consider starting a guide based on agreed
   upon conventions.
